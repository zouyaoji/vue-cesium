# Translation

## Documentation

In this chapter, we will discuss how to help translating the documentation of Vue for Cesium.

### Background

Most of the contributors use online translator for their non-native languages, sometimes it would be not only inaccurate but also stressful to them.

### How do I translate the documentation?

Add your language in the project's `docs.vitepress\i18n\lang.json` file. Copy the `docs\en-US` directory and its subfiles from the Vue for Cesium project, rename it to your language, and then translate the files in this directory.
